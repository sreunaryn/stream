Understood, Your Majesty.

Bam!

21:53.208 --> 21:54.666
[Red Girl yells] Whoa!

21:54.750 --> 21:57.333
That Monkey's gonna burn down
the whole village.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.416
-Come on, everyone. [grunts]

Whoa! [shrieks]

22:24.000 --> 22:27.166
Do you really think you can defeat me?

22:27.250 --> 22:30.083
No. I know it. [yells]

22:30.833 --> 22:32.833
And for the beef dish, sire,

22:32.916 --> 22:34.833
lettuce-wrapped or skewers?

22:34.916 --> 22:35.750

Skewers it is.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.250
Boom!

23:04.333 --> 23:05.666
What a team!

23:05.750 --> 23:07.916
Where did you get that stick?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.666
It's fantastic!

23:09.750 --> 23:10.916
[Stick murmurs]

23:11.000 --> 23:13.750
Good idea, Stick. Hey, you want it?

23:13.833 --> 23:15.750
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Gimme, gimme, gimme!

23:15.833 --> 23:18.916
If you can hold it for ten seconds,
it's yours.

23:20.208 --> 23:22.250
[Red Girl] One, two…

-Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo!

23:35.791 --> 23:36.625
Yes!

23:36.708 --> 23:37.750
Mwah!

23:37.833 --> 23:40.708
One-hundredth demon vanquished!

23:40.791 --> 23:43.666
-Monkey King reigns supreme!
-[Stick protests]

23:43.750 --> 23:44.625
And Stick.

23:44.708 --> 23:48.083
Incredible. You got her
to fall right into your trap.

23:48.166 --> 23:51.125
-I will learn so much from you.
-[groans] You're still here?

23:51.208 --> 23:53.750
Please. My name is Lin.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.916
I am but a lowly peasant girl
from a tiny village

23:57.000 --> 23:59.208
who hopes to make a difference someday.

23:59.291 --> 24:03.208
I offer my skills as your humble assistant
and weapon-bearer.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.166
Wow. My own assistant?

Hard pass.

This monkey heroes alone.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.083
Oh.

24:14.166 --> 24:17.083
So, you got
my big victory speech ready, right?

24:17.166 --> 24:18.708
Um, well, I--

24:18.791 --> 24:23.583
Well, then, grab yourself a scroll

the ape didn't succumb

25:49.125 --> 25:52.041
to our fiery little minx as I'd hoped.

25:52.125 --> 25:53.125
Time to move.

One hundred demons defeated.

26:19.250 --> 26:21.083
Wow. What an accomplishment.

26:21.166 --> 26:24.583
The Immortal Ones can welcome me
with open arms now.

26:25.708 --> 26:27.291
I said now!

-[Dragon King] You!
-Ho ho!

26:40.875 --> 26:41.708
Huh?

26:41.791 --> 26:44.541
You are no hero!

26:44.625 --> 26:46.041
You're a thief!

Aw, you're not the Immortal Ones.

Uh-oh.

That is mine!

-What's wrong, Stick? You know this chump?
-[Stick groans]

26:56.250 --> 26:58.125
Stick? You never talked to me.

26:58.208 --> 27:00.500
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Who are you anyway?

27:00.583 --> 27:05.791
I am the undersea ruler of the--

-What?
-Oh, look at his face.

-Low humidity. Arid climate.
-[villagers] Ew!

Don't look at me!
No, no, no. Be right back.

[Dragon King sighs]

27:20.250 --> 27:22.291
[Dragon King] So invigorating.

-…undersea ruler of the dragon kingdom.
-What? Come on.

27:28.208 --> 27:32.125
And you, sir, stole my stick.

27:32.208 --> 27:34.958
No, I didn't.
I found it at the bottom of the ocean.

27:35.041 --> 27:37.041
Right in the middle of some tacky palace.

27:37.125 --> 27:40.125
Tacky? Once I reclaim my stick,

27:40.208 --> 27:45.791
you and all these air-breathers
will suffer my… my…

27:46.541 --> 27:47.375
Again?

And there it is. [laughs]

28:04.791 --> 28:07.791
Hey, Babbo, how will we know
when we're under the stick?

28:07.875 --> 28:09.833
Easy. The stick will be right above us.

28:09.916 --> 28:12.041
How will we know we took the right stick?

28:12.125 --> 28:13.750
[scoffs] There's only one choice.

28:13.833 --> 28:17.083
But what if we choose wrong, Babbo?

28:17.166 --> 28:19.041
Look at that armor.

28:19.125 --> 28:21.708
Who even wears brass with gold?

28:21.791 --> 28:26.500
Look, buddy, I hear ya. You love my stick.
Everyone loves the stick.

28:26.583 --> 28:29.833
But no one appreciates the stick
like I do.

-[Stick murmurs urgently]
-Quiet! The grown-ups are talking.

28:33.333 --> 28:36.250
And now you're ruining
my exclusive ceremony.

28:36.333 --> 28:39.833
Point is, Stick is not going anywhere.

28:39.916 --> 28:42.541
-Ain't that right, Stick? Buddy?
-[henchman 2] Ow!

Stick, left!

29:21.958 --> 29:23.083
[henchmen groan]

29:23.166 --> 29:24.208
And to the right!

29:24.791 --> 29:25.875

Ha ha! You missed!

29:29.708 --> 29:32.083
[exciting music continues]

29:32.166 --> 29:35.708
Stick, darling, it's Dragon.

29:35.791 --> 29:37.833
-He's mine!
-Jump in the tub!

29:37.916 --> 29:39.666
He only listens to me, flaky.

29:39.750 --> 29:42.541
I don't see a ring on it, honey! [grunts]

29:45.625 --> 29:47.458
Itching! Flaking!

29:47.541 --> 29:49.541
[exciting music continues]

29:52.708 --> 29:54.541
-Huh.
-[dramatic music plays]

29:55.250 --> 29:57.750
Of course! An avalanche.

29:57.833 --> 30:00.166
-Hit the brake!
-[Monkey King] Fun ride, huh?

30:00.750 --> 30:02.583
-[henchmen groan]
-[Monkey King] See ya!

30:02.666 --> 30:05.291
-[henchman 2] Babbo!
-[Babbo] Curse you, gravity!

30:05.375 --> 30:08.833
Ha ha! Monkey King reigns supreme!

30:08.916 --> 30:09.833
Huh?

30:10.416 --> 30:11.958
[Dragon King] Stick!

30:12.041 --> 30:13.208
Catch me!

30:13.291 --> 30:17.708
My palace is not tacky!

30:20.541 --> 30:21.791
[Stick hums]

30:23.041 --> 30:24.666
[Lin panting] Gotcha!

30:24.750 --> 30:26.000
[grunts]

30:26.583 --> 30:27.916
Dragon King?

30:28.541 --> 30:29.458
[Lin] Agh!

30:29.541 --> 30:32.791
Fear not, little girl.
The villain is gone.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.291
Maybe you're not as useless as I thought.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.750
-So, do I have the job?
-Um…

30:39.833 --> 30:40.666
Nope.

30:41.416 --> 30:42.750
[Lin] Oh, come on.

30:45.208 --> 30:48.583
Twenty minutes, and still no invite
from the Jade Emperor.

30:48.666 --> 30:50.083
-What am I missing?
-[murmurs]

30:50.166 --> 30:54.083
Immortality! Of course.
It's right in the name.

30:54.166 --> 30:57.500
To become an Immortal One,
I need immortality!

30:57.583 --> 30:59.000
[Lin] Maybe I can help.

30:59.583 --> 31:00.791
[Monkey King groans]

31:00.875 --> 31:02.958
Okay, look, kid. You see this?

31:04.083 --> 31:05.541
Your palm?

31:05.625 --> 31:09.541
No! I mean, yes. But no. This here is me.

31:09.625 --> 31:10.666
Okay?

31:10.750 --> 31:13.833
And this tiny thing is you.

31:13.916 --> 31:15.375
-Get it now?
-Huh?

31:15.458 --> 31:17.125
[Monkey King] I'm the universe hand,

31:17.208 --> 31:20.083
and you're an insignificant,
useless pebble.

31:20.875 --> 31:23.625
Even a tiny pebble
can make a big ripple, you know.

31:23.708 --> 31:27.041
[scoffs] That's just
what a tiny pebble would say.

31:27.125 --> 31:30.416
So, Stick, immortality, where do we go?

31:30.500 --> 31:31.500
[Stick hums]

31:31.583 --> 31:33.333
Really? Huh.

31:33.416 --> 31:35.333
-But how do we get there?
-[Stick hums]

31:35.416 --> 31:38.041
A graveyard? Spooky.

31:38.708 --> 31:40.208
Huh…

31:40.291 --> 31:42.041
Grave… Gra…

31:42.125 --> 31:44.291
-Graveyard.
-You can't read.

31:44.375 --> 31:45.583
Of course I can.

31:45.666 --> 31:49.125
That's grass. That's the sky.
That's a rock. See? Reading.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.250
-Graveyard's that way.
-Obviously.

31:52.333 --> 31:55.500
-[Stick hums]
-No, no, no, no, no. We don't need her.

31:55.583 --> 31:58.333
-He wants me to come. Doesn't he?
-Just go home, kid.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.625
I can't go home.
There's trouble back there,

32:00.708 --> 32:02.333
and it made me do some things.

32:02.416 --> 32:05.416
-Things I probably shouldn't have done.
-Ooh! You killed someone?

32:05.500 --> 32:06.791
-No!
-Oh.

32:06.875 --> 32:09.750
I just wanna do big things someday.
Like you.

32:12.875 --> 32:14.041
-Ow!
-[Stick murmurs]

32:14.125 --> 32:16.666
-I know. No. I--
-[Stick murmurs]

32:16.750 --> 32:18.125
-Yes, but--
-[Stick murmurs]

32:18.208 --> 32:20.458
How much reading could we possibly need?

32:20.541 --> 32:24.166
-[Stick murmurs]
-Fine. I said fine! [sighs]

32:24.250 --> 32:25.500
So, assistant girl,

32:26.083 --> 32:27.250
you coming or what?

32:27.958 --> 32:29.333
[Lin] So, where to next?

32:29.416 --> 32:33.208
[Monkey King] Oh, you'll see. [laughs]

32:38.250 --> 32:39.333
[Monkey King] Ooh.

32:43.291 --> 32:46.000
In there? Us? How?

32:46.083 --> 32:49.041
This. It's like an all-access VIP pass.

32:49.125 --> 32:52.166
Any realm, any dimension.
Even the Land of the Dead.

32:52.250 --> 32:53.916
But you're not dead.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.291
And if all goes well, never will be.

32:56.375 --> 32:59.416
Okay. If we're gonna fit in,
we gotta dress the part.

33:00.708 --> 33:02.208
[coughs] What the heck?

33:02.291 --> 33:03.333
[Monkey King] Not heck.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.083
Hell.

33:05.166 --> 33:06.041
[Lin screams]

33:06.125 --> 33:07.916
[suspenseful music crescendos]

33:08.708 --> 33:10.375
[Lin screams and groans]

33:12.333 --> 33:13.416
Try to keep up.

33:14.375 --> 33:15.208
[grunts]

33:17.541 --> 33:19.416
Are we even supposed to be here?

33:19.500 --> 33:21.750
Absolutely not. Isn't it great?

33:21.833 --> 33:23.750
See, the day you're supposed to die

33:23.833 --> 33:26.458
is recorded
in the Scroll of Life and Death.

33:26.541 --> 33:29.208
But if my name should somehow
get crossed out,

33:29.291 --> 33:32.250
then no death registered,
and guess who's immortal?

33:32.750 --> 33:34.333
Me! [laughs]

33:35.166 --> 33:36.000
[shudders]

33:36.875 --> 33:40.541
One more thing.
Die in hell, stay in hell. So don't die.

33:42.208 --> 33:43.708
This is a bad idea.

33:44.791 --> 33:45.625
[demon] Next.

33:45.708 --> 33:47.708
[ghosts whisper]

33:49.458 --> 33:50.916
Act like a ghost.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.666
Whoo! Eee!

33:53.750 --> 33:57.541
Oh yeah. Great. You're giving me chills.

33:57.625 --> 33:59.416
King here! Coming through!

33:59.500 --> 34:00.791
Make way.

34:00.875 --> 34:03.875
Next! Release form. [groans]

34:03.958 --> 34:07.000
You brought a live chicken
to the underworld?

34:07.833 --> 34:09.416
No living things allowed!

34:10.458 --> 34:11.791
We really should go now.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.791
[scoffs] Watch and learn, Pebble.

34:13.875 --> 34:14.791
[chicken squawks]

34:14.875 --> 34:16.000
Oh no.

34:16.083 --> 34:21.416
That's better. Pit of Infinite Agony.
Fourth floor on your right. Next!

34:22.041 --> 34:23.625
Yes, good morning.

34:23.708 --> 34:26.291
I'd like a quick glance
at the Life and Death Scrolls.

34:26.375 --> 34:28.083
Release form first.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.041
It's in my other armor?

34:30.125 --> 34:33.541
Rejected! [growls]

34:34.416 --> 34:36.583
-Release form.
-Back to the world of the living.

34:36.666 --> 34:38.291
Not so fast.

34:38.375 --> 34:41.375
-As my assistant, your first duty…
-[Lin groans]

34:41.458 --> 34:43.916
…is to be the sacrificial lamb.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.375
-What are you doing?
-She's alive? Here in hell?

34:46.458 --> 34:47.916
-What?
-You're alive!

34:48.000 --> 34:49.250
How scandalous!

34:49.333 --> 34:51.750
And you cut in front of all these people?

34:51.833 --> 34:54.666
-What?
-No living things allowed!

34:55.458 --> 34:57.291
-Oh, Monkey!
-[Monkey cackles]

34:57.375 --> 34:59.333
Uh, uh, I… I'm not…

34:59.416 --> 35:02.041
I couldn't be more dead.
Fresh corpse here.

35:02.541 --> 35:04.791
How did you die?

35:04.875 --> 35:07.791
Old age. No, I mean scurvy. Earthquake?

35:07.875 --> 35:09.500
A duel. Two duels.

35:09.583 --> 35:10.666
Here's the story.

35:10.750 --> 35:15.375
I fell… off a cliff
into a hole filled with sharks.

35:15.458 --> 35:16.625
Rabid sharks.

35:16.708 --> 35:18.625
And then a house fell on me,

35:18.708 --> 35:21.000
and I drowned. Yeah.

35:22.708 --> 35:24.250
Okay, you're in.

35:24.333 --> 35:26.208
Chamber of Ridiculous Deaths.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.375
Fifth floor down the hall.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.708
[gasps] Hm.

35:29.791 --> 35:30.708
Next!

35:31.458 --> 35:32.541
[Lin panting]

35:32.625 --> 35:34.625
-[ominous music plays]
-[Lin grunts]

35:35.500 --> 35:37.750
[grunts]

35:38.291 --> 35:41.750
-[screams]
-[ghost] What a guy.

35:42.375 --> 35:43.416
-Hey!
-[screams]

35:43.500 --> 35:46.375
Monkey! You abandoned me
in the middle of hell.

35:46.458 --> 35:48.541
You don't leave a teammate behind.

35:48.625 --> 35:53.000
What teammate? You're an assistant.
An insignificant pebble.

35:53.083 --> 35:55.541
-Stop calling me that.
-Absolutely.

35:55.625 --> 35:59.375
As soon as you find my scroll
so I can cross my name off. Come on.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.291
-[Lin groans]
-[metal clangs]

36:01.375 --> 36:03.708
-[grunts] This shouldn't take long.
-[Lin gasps]

36:04.333 --> 36:05.833
[Lin] What?

36:06.625 --> 36:08.500
Get reading.

36:08.583 --> 36:11.208
[whistles]

36:12.541 --> 36:13.666
What's your family name?

36:13.750 --> 36:16.125
Don't have one. I was born from a rock.

36:16.625 --> 36:17.750
A rock?

36:17.833 --> 36:22.125
More of a rock egg.
The scrolls list your family history.

36:22.208 --> 36:24.458
I must have parents, right?

36:24.541 --> 36:26.166
Well, I guess.

36:26.250 --> 36:27.500
Everyone does.

36:28.041 --> 36:32.000
Ha! Looking for your scrolls? [laughs]

36:32.083 --> 36:34.416
My scroll? Why does he have my scroll?

36:34.500 --> 36:36.583
You don't belong here,

36:37.500 --> 36:39.583
outsiders.

36:39.666 --> 36:43.708
Oh ho! Time to defeat demon 101.

36:43.791 --> 36:46.041
[demon] Mighty brush! Stamp of doom!

36:47.708 --> 36:50.958
Open! Hyah!

36:51.041 --> 36:53.750
-[clone 1] Don't let them get away!
-[clone 2] Capture them!

36:53.833 --> 36:55.291
[clone 3] Stop the monkey!

36:55.375 --> 36:58.375
Through 115.

36:58.458 --> 36:59.458
[clones grunt]

36:59.541 --> 37:01.375
-Clones, eh?
-[Stick murmurs]

37:01.458 --> 37:04.083
I can? Really? Cool!

37:04.166 --> 37:06.166
[exciting music plays]

37:07.083 --> 37:08.083
[Monkey King grunts]

37:08.833 --> 37:11.083
Monkey King reigns supreme!

37:11.166 --> 37:13.083
-[demon clones grunt]
-[Lin yelps]

37:13.166 --> 37:14.833
-[Monkey King grunts]
-[clones grunt]

37:14.916 --> 37:16.458
Bring it! [grunts]

37:16.541 --> 37:17.625
[Monkey King] Woo-hoo!

37:17.708 --> 37:20.416
[grunting]

37:20.500 --> 37:21.541
Not the beard!

37:21.625 --> 37:22.666
Woo-hoo!

37:23.208 --> 37:24.083
Next!

37:24.625 --> 37:25.958
[Monkey King grunts]

37:26.041 --> 37:27.250
[Monkey King laughs]

37:27.333 --> 37:30.083
[Monkey King] Shaolin soccer! [yells]

37:30.666 --> 37:32.875
-[Lin yelps]
-[demon grunts]

37:32.958 --> 37:35.958
-Wait! Time-out. I'm not a part of this.
-Nobody's on the bench!

37:36.541 --> 37:38.541
-[Monkey King] Woo-hoo!
-[Stick murmurs]

37:38.625 --> 37:40.500
-[demon] Get her!
-[Monkey King] Duck!

37:42.083 --> 37:43.000
Got 'em.

37:43.083 --> 37:44.291
[Lin yells]

37:46.958 --> 37:50.291
Monkey, I got 'em. This one's mine. Huh?

37:51.250 --> 37:53.166
Hey! Not yours!

37:54.291 --> 37:57.458
What's it say about my family? [yells]

37:57.541 --> 37:58.583
It says

37:59.500 --> 38:00.791
you don't have one.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.958
Oh. I'm all alone?

38:04.041 --> 38:05.416
I'm sorry, Monkey.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.041
-Which means--
-[demon grunts]

38:07.125 --> 38:09.583
Oof! I'm an original!

38:09.666 --> 38:10.666
One of a kind!

38:10.750 --> 38:13.000
-Give me that scroll.
-Third line from the bottom.

38:13.083 --> 38:18.875
Step away from the scroll,
you flea-bitten, mortal lowlife! Close!

38:18.958 --> 38:19.875
Come on!

38:20.458 --> 38:22.000
[Lin whimpers]

38:22.958 --> 38:25.375
-[Monkey King] Uh-oh.
-[Lin screams]

38:26.083 --> 38:27.166
Got it.

38:28.625 --> 38:30.583
[grunts] Yeah, baby!

38:30.666 --> 38:32.125
Monkey King!

38:32.208 --> 38:33.416
Oh, her.

38:33.500 --> 38:34.958
[demon laughs]

38:35.041 --> 38:36.916
Ow! That hurt.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.250
[Monkey King] Hee-yah!

38:39.875 --> 38:41.875
-[demon groans]
-[Monkey King laughs]

38:42.583 --> 38:45.125
And now I'm immortal!

38:46.250 --> 38:47.791
[Lin screams]

38:47.875 --> 38:49.583
[dramatic music plays]

38:49.666 --> 38:51.250
Even for hell, this is bad.

38:53.291 --> 38:55.291
[serene music plays]

38:57.125 --> 39:01.000
What's up, Yama?
Or should I say, what's down? [laughs]

39:01.083 --> 39:04.916
I beseech you.
A rogue primate has invaded hell and-- Ow!

39:05.000 --> 39:08.250
Hey, uh, Jade Emperor, right?
Listen, great news.

39:08.333 --> 39:12.166
Get the Immortal Ones together.
I'm on my way. We're gonna be neighbors.

39:12.250 --> 39:15.125
So you're the Monkey King.

39:15.208 --> 39:16.541
Gonna party at your banquets.

39:16.625 --> 39:17.958
-Get hammered.
-Release form!

39:18.041 --> 39:22.083
-We're gonna share battle stories.
-Please. You're not one of us.

39:22.166 --> 39:25.583
Actually, I am.
Crossed my name out and everything.

39:25.666 --> 39:28.083
That only makes you half-immortal.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.208
-Half?
-You can't die of old age.

39:30.291 --> 39:31.541
Oh, that's great!

39:31.625 --> 39:33.708
But you can still die in battle.

39:33.791 --> 39:35.041
-Huh?
-[Stick murmurs]

39:36.458 --> 39:38.750
Don't look at me. This was your plan.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.458
Well, this is new information.

39:41.541 --> 39:44.541
So, how exactly
does one get full immortality?

39:44.625 --> 39:45.916
You don't. Not possible.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.291
Well, there is
The Book of Everlasting Life, my lord.

39:49.375 --> 39:52.166
-You shut your beard hole right now!
-My bad.

39:52.875 --> 39:55.416
-Stick, door!
-[Stick murmurs]

39:55.500 --> 39:56.666
Assistant, book!

39:56.750 --> 39:58.750
Monkey, stay handsome.

39:58.833 --> 40:01.083
[Stick murmurs]

40:01.166 --> 40:02.333

[Monkey King laughs]

40:04.875 --> 40:05.708
[Yama groans]

40:05.791 --> 40:09.458
Whatever you do,
don't let him leave with that book!

40:09.541 --> 40:10.416
Let's go.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.125
Oh! Don't!

40:12.208 --> 40:13.583
-[Lin groans]
-Uh-oh.

Catch him! Catch him!

-[Lin] Agh!

[Monkey King] Hee-yah!

40:35.958 --> 40:37.791
[Lin screams]

40:37.875 --> 40:42.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Monkey!

40:42.083 --> 40:43.541
[dramatic music fades]

40:43.625 --> 40:47.916
Ha! Well, that was fun. You got the book?

40:48.000 --> 40:50.833
-Uh, um, uh…
-You didn't lose it, did you?

40:50.916 --> 40:51.958
Uh, uh--

40:52.041 --> 40:53.291
You had one job!

40:53.375 --> 40:55.541
One job and you blew it!

40:55.625 --> 40:56.833
Uh…

40:58.083 --> 40:59.166
Aha!

40:59.250 --> 41:02.458
-Just messing with you!
-Do you treat all your friends like this?

41:02.541 --> 41:08.166
Friends? Whoa, okay. You're more like
a teammate on my very critical mission.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.208
Well, that's better than a pebble.

41:10.291 --> 41:12.250
All right. Moving on. See this?

41:12.333 --> 41:15.708
This book can tell us
how I can get my full immortality.

41:15.791 --> 41:16.833
-Uh…
-What's it say?

41:16.916 --> 41:19.250
Okay. Uh, it says…

41:19.333 --> 41:22.750
Oh. "Full immortality can be attained
by eating a magical peach

41:22.833 --> 41:26.125
from the Enchanted Orchard
of Everlasting Life."

Take my stick and whack me in the face.
It's all right. Come on, come on. Do it.

51:54.291 --> 51:55.583
I won't even feel it.

51:56.916 --> 52:01.000
-[groans] Fine. I'll do it myself, wuss.
-[Lin snarls]

52:02.458 --> 52:03.291
Ow!

52:03.791 --> 52:06.791
-Those peaches were defective.
-Maybe they're out of season.

52:06.875 --> 52:10.458
-What? Our quest has failed, Stick.
-[Stick groans]

52:10.541 --> 52:12.625
-[groans]
-You're still half-immortal.

52:12.708 --> 52:14.291
I don't do half-things.

52:14.375 --> 52:15.833
Yeah, I noticed.

52:16.375 --> 52:17.625
[sighs]

52:17.708 --> 52:21.166
This old geezer once told me
all the things I couldn't do.

52:21.250 --> 52:22.625
That I'd wind up alone.

52:25.541 --> 52:28.166
Yeah. "You'll never amount to anything."

52:28.708 --> 52:31.833
I heard that all the time
back home. [sighs]

52:32.791 --> 52:33.625
Wow.

52:35.291 --> 52:36.541
Wish I could relate.

52:36.625 --> 52:38.916
Well, thanks for your help.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.208
-I mean, it was mostly me.
-You're leaving?

52:41.291 --> 52:44.041
-It was nice knowing you, little girl.
-But no!

52:44.125 --> 52:46.875
[grunts] Don't go.
You said we were family.

52:46.958 --> 52:48.083
-No, I didn't.
-You did.

52:48.166 --> 52:49.208
Doesn't sound like me.

52:49.291 --> 52:52.041
-Well, you said it.
-That was just the peaches talking.

52:52.125 --> 52:55.291
But you promised we'd do big things.
We can't give up now.

52:55.375 --> 52:57.708
"We"? Who's this "we"?

52:57.791 --> 52:59.791
I'm still gonna join the Immortal Ones.

52:59.875 --> 53:02.041
-Just not with you.
-[Lin groans]

53:02.125 --> 53:05.791
You know what? I'm starting to think
that wasn't even the real peach orchard.

53:05.875 --> 53:07.041
What? [laughs awkwardly]

53:07.125 --> 53:10.625
You think I… I deliberately
brought you to the wrong place?

53:10.708 --> 53:13.250
L-L-Like some sort of…
Like some sort of trap?

53:13.333 --> 53:15.000
You're saying I lied to you?

53:15.083 --> 53:16.791
I'm not not saying it.

53:16.875 --> 53:20.250
You know what? Go ahead.
Walk away. You're so selfish.

53:20.333 --> 53:22.041
You only care about yourself.

53:22.666 --> 53:26.375
-Well, no one else will.
-Ugh! 'Cause you won't let them.

53:27.291 --> 53:31.250
Someday, you really will end up all alone.

53:34.791 --> 53:36.083
[gentle music plays]

53:39.375 --> 53:40.208
Hm.

53:40.291 --> 53:45.666
-Hm.
-[Stick murmurs]

53:45.750 --> 53:48.000
-What are you yapping on about?
-[Stick murmurs]

53:48.083 --> 53:50.833
Who's that? Assistant, what does it say?

53:50.916 --> 53:54.083
"An authority on everlasting life,
the royal sorceress, Wangmu,

53:54.166 --> 53:59.458
can often be found in her laboratory
brewing her famous Elixir of Immortality."

53:59.958 --> 54:03.625
We're back in the game!
One sip and they'll have to accept me.

54:03.708 --> 54:05.750
Way to go, Stick! Mwah!

54:07.000 --> 54:09.125
You too, Pebble. What are we waiting for?

54:09.208 --> 54:12.625
-But that's in heaven.
-Monkey King reigns supreme!

54:12.708 --> 54:18.041
[Lin yells]

54:18.125 --> 54:19.833
Is that the Jade Palace?

54:19.916 --> 54:21.333
Absolutely.

54:21.416 --> 54:23.541
-[Monkey King grunts]
-[Lin screams]

54:23.625 --> 54:24.958
[exciting music plays]

54:25.041 --> 54:26.750
-[Monkey King] Woo-hoo!
-What the--

54:26.833 --> 54:28.416
[Lin screams]

54:31.708 --> 54:33.041
[exciting music fades]

54:34.958 --> 54:37.166
[Lin] There she is. Wangmu.

54:37.250 --> 54:38.166
[Wangmu grunts]

54:38.250 --> 54:39.541
The queen of heaven.

54:39.625 --> 54:43.041
Yeah, whatever. Let's go make me immortal.

54:43.125 --> 54:44.708
[Lin grunts and groans]

[Monkey King grunts]

54:54.416 --> 54:55.291
Locked.

54:55.375 --> 54:56.416
Oh!

54:56.958 --> 54:58.458
[Monkey King laughs]

54:58.541 --> 55:00.916
No. No, no, no! Monkey!

55:01.583 --> 55:06.250
Somewhere in this room are the ingredients
for making the Elixir of Immortality.

55:06.333 --> 55:09.375
-Guess I'll just have to taste everything.
-No. No. Wait.

55:09.958 --> 55:12.083
-First thing we need is--
-Here goes nothing.

55:12.166 --> 55:13.625
Hey, don't drink that.

55:13.708 --> 55:16.541
-I'm just smelling it.
-[Lin] Don't smell anything.

55:17.375 --> 55:18.458
[Stick murmurs]

55:19.416 --> 55:20.375
Uh, Monkey?

-Ooh.

55:30.166 --> 55:32.750
Wha… Wha… Huh?

55:33.958 --> 55:35.208
[Monkey King shrieks]

55:36.500 --> 55:37.500
[Lin growls]

55:38.208 --> 55:40.666

-Huh?

55:40.750 --> 55:41.833
[Monkey King shrieks]

55:44.583 --> 55:50.166
[Monkey King whimpers]

55:52.250 --> 55:54.416
[whimpering continues]

55:55.000 --> 55:57.416
[grunts] Okay, Lin. You got this.

55:57.500 --> 56:00.875
Don't look back. Don't look back.
Don't… look… back.

56:00.958 --> 56:02.541
[Monkey King bawls]

-[Monkey squeals]
-Oh! [laughs]

56:09.541 --> 56:12.791
Aw, you're just a scared little monkey.

56:12.875 --> 56:15.250
No friends. No family.

56:15.958 --> 56:16.875
You are alone.

56:16.958 --> 56:18.500
[Monkey King mewls]

56:18.583 --> 56:20.583
[sad music plays]

56:21.833 --> 56:23.083
Sorry, Monkey.

56:23.791 --> 56:25.666
I can't fool around anymore.

56:26.708 --> 56:28.625
My people are counting on me.

56:28.708 --> 56:31.208
[Monkey King whimpers]

56:31.291 --> 56:32.625
Oh!

56:33.291 --> 56:37.291
-Oh! Agh!
-Gee, why'd you trash this place?

56:37.375 --> 56:38.875
-We're guests here.
-[Lin groans]

56:38.958 --> 56:41.541
Show a little respect. Immortality Elixir?

56:41.625 --> 56:44.000
Hello? Come on.
I'm not paying you to goof around.

56:44.083 --> 56:45.500
Yeah. Uh-huh.

56:45.583 --> 56:48.125
-We're not actually paying her, are we?
-[Stick hums]

56:48.208 --> 56:50.958
Right. The first ingredient is…

56:51.750 --> 56:54.083
There. A pinch of instant karma.

56:54.166 --> 56:56.625
-Get mixing.
-[woman] Stealing from an old lady?

56:56.708 --> 56:58.583
You have no honor.

56:58.666 --> 56:59.875
-Uh-oh.
-[laughs]

56:59.958 --> 57:01.291
First, I punish you.

57:01.375 --> 57:03.375
Then I shame you.

57:03.458 --> 57:04.916
You can't shame me.

57:05.625 --> 57:07.458
I have no shame.

57:07.541 --> 57:10.833
And you have no exit.

57:13.416 --> 57:15.375
Don't worry, kid. I'll take care of her.

57:15.458 --> 57:18.791
Eat lightning, chimp! [laughs]

57:18.875 --> 57:20.875
Immortality Elixir! Let's go!

57:20.958 --> 57:22.166
[Monkey King grunts]

57:22.250 --> 57:23.416
[Wangmu] Ha! [grunts]

57:23.500 --> 57:26.166
A spoonful of chi. There! The blue jar.

57:26.250 --> 57:28.041
A spoonful of chi coming up.

-[Lin gasps]

57:30.375 --> 57:31.750
[exciting music plays]

57:31.833 --> 57:35.250
-[Monkey King] What's next?
-A drop of moon essence. The green jar.

57:35.333 --> 57:37.708
-Bad monkey!
-[Monkey King] On it.

57:37.791 --> 57:39.250
Ha! Missed!

57:39.333 --> 57:40.166
Yes!

57:40.666 --> 57:41.583
Hee-yah!

57:43.041 --> 57:44.458
-That's it.
-[Monkey] What else?

57:44.541 --> 57:45.916
Last one. Nectar of peach.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.791
Yes! Um…

57:47.875 --> 57:49.625
-Yes!
-[Wangmu growls]

57:49.708 --> 57:52.375
-Here you go.
-[Wangmu] This is going to sting!

57:52.458 --> 57:54.583
[laughs]

57:54.666 --> 57:59.958
You call yourself a god?
I'm so disappointed. What a bummer.

58:00.583 --> 58:01.625
[Wangmu yells]

58:01.708 --> 58:04.666
Um, it's stuck!
I-I need a spoon or chopsticks or--

58:04.750 --> 58:07.000
-Stick, help her.
-[Stick yells]

58:07.083 --> 58:08.750
-Perfect.
-[Monkey King] Ha ha!

58:08.833 --> 58:10.833
[dramatic music plays]

58:12.375 --> 58:13.500
I think I did it!

58:13.583 --> 58:15.000
-Taste this. [grunts]
-Right.

58:15.083 --> 58:16.541
Taste death!

58:17.458 --> 58:19.666
Agh! No! [gasps]

58:19.750 --> 58:21.958
That does it! [grunts]

58:22.041 --> 58:24.958
[both grunt]

58:26.208 --> 58:28.916
[Monkey King] Nice punch, Grandma!

58:29.000 --> 58:32.541
Your friend's not here
to protect you now. [laughs]

58:32.625 --> 58:35.041
Uh, we're not friends. I'm his assistant.

58:35.125 --> 58:36.000
His what?

58:36.083 --> 58:37.791
[screams] I'm just a pebble.

58:39.208 --> 58:40.041
[Lin screams]

58:40.125 --> 58:41.666
I'm only after his stick.

58:41.750 --> 58:43.833
I need it to save my village
from a drought.

58:43.916 --> 58:50.708
So, the thief's assistant
is also a thief. [laughs]

58:50.791 --> 58:52.791
[Monkey King] Woo-hoo!

58:52.875 --> 58:56.666
Take his stick and go!
The Jade Emperor will see you home.

58:57.166 --> 58:59.375
[Lin grunts]

58:59.875 --> 59:01.541
What are you going to do to him?

59:01.625 --> 59:04.500
That selfish creature
doesn't care about you.

59:04.583 --> 59:05.458
Run!

59:05.541 --> 59:06.416
[sighs]

59:07.083 --> 59:07.958
[Wangmu] Ya!

59:09.333 --> 59:10.958

59:11.041 --> 59:13.333
Ha ha! Stick, where are you?

59:13.416 --> 59:17.250
-Whoa!
-Back for more, Monkey?

59:17.333 --> 59:19.708
-Uh-oh.
-[panting] Don't look back!

59:19.791 --> 59:21.708
Don't look back! Don't look back.

-[Wangmu laughs]
-No, not this time.

59:25.625 --> 59:27.625
[Wangmu laughs]

59:27.708 --> 59:30.208
Goodbye, mortal.

59:30.958 --> 59:33.208
Half-mortal.

59:33.291 --> 59:34.875
[Monkey King groans]

59:34.958 --> 59:39.875
You couldn't possibly think
you were worthy to take your place here

59:39.958 --> 59:43.041
amongst us Immortal Ones.

59:43.125 --> 59:46.500
[Wangmu laughs]

That was fun.

Agh!

[dramatic music plays]

59:53.125 --> 59:54.333
What?

59:55.208 --> 59:56.791
Oh ho ho!

59:58.333 --> 01:00:01.083
I love it when people tell me
what I can't do.

01:00:01.166 --> 01:00:02.125
[Wangmu grunts]

Whoa!

My lightning makes you stronger?

01:00:13.291 --> 01:00:16.583
I'm immortal!

01:00:16.666 --> 01:00:18.208
[Stick squeals excitedly]

01:00:18.291 --> 01:00:20.708
And huge!

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:22.916
I'm one of you now.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.958
You will never be one of us!

01:00:26.041 --> 01:00:27.750
-Monkey!
-Who's gonna stop me?

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:33.458
I summon the Immortal Ones!

01:00:33.541 --> 01:00:35.625
-I'm already here!
-[Lin] They're coming!

01:00:35.708 --> 01:00:39.500
-We gotta get out of here!
-What are they gonna do? I can't die.

01:00:39.583 --> 01:00:43.583
There are fates far worse than death.

01:00:43.666 --> 01:00:45.250
We really should go now.

01:00:45.333 --> 01:00:49.750
Bring 'em on! I am a god.

01:00:49.833 --> 01:00:52.375
-Monkey!
-What? I'm busy!

01:00:52.458 --> 01:00:53.750
Bet you can't catch me.

01:01:02.083 --> 01:01:04.708
He's coming. He's coming. He's coming.

01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:06.666
He's not coming!

[panting]

01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:19.000
You came back

01:01:19.916 --> 01:01:20.750
for me.

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:23.166
-What's your deal?
-You came back for me!

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:25.000
I so could've beaten that old lady.

01:01:25.083 --> 01:01:27.375
-But you didn't because you care.
-No.

01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:29.291
-Admit it. You care. Say it.
-No!

01:01:29.375 --> 01:01:30.375
-Say, "I care."
-Never.

01:01:30.458 --> 01:01:32.250
-Come on, admit it!
-I admit nothing!

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:34.208
He so cares about me.

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:35.541
-[Stick murmurs]
-I know!

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:40.083

-To do what?
-Defeat all the Immortal Ones.

the new king of heaven.

-That could be your new, uh, path.
-Hm.

by lending out the stick for--

Okay. How about I rip off my tail
and give that away too? I mean, come on.

01:02:55.541 --> 01:02:58.791
You're the only mortal I know
who's gone to hell and heaven in one day.

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:02.291
That wasn't my accomplishment.
That was you.

I could make a difference, right?
